OmniJSON
========

The Problem
-----------

::

    # Python 2.5.4 (r254:67916, Jun 24 2010, 21:47:25)
    >>> import anyjson
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
        raise ImportError("No supported JSON module found")
    ImportError: No supported JSON module found


The Solution
------------

::

    >>> import omnijson as json
    # \o/


Features
--------

- Loads whichever is the fastest JSON module installed
- Falls back on built in pure-python simplejson, just in case.
- Proper API (``loads()``, ``dumps()``)
- Vendorizable
- Supports Python 2.5-3.2 out of the box


Usage
-----

Load the best JSON available::

    import omnijson as json

Dump some objects::

    >>> json.loads('{"yo": "dawg"}')
    {'yo': 'dawg'}

Load some objects::

    >>> json.dumps({'yo': 'dawg'})
    '{"yo": "dawg"}'

Check JSON 
::

    >>> json.core.engine
    'ujson'

Install
-------

Installing OmniJSON is easy::

    $ pip install omnijson

Of, if you must::

    $ easy_install omnijson

But, you `really shouldn't do that
